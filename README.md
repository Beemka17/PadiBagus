   PadiBagus:<br> Disease detection on rice leaves using TensorFlow Lite model 
</h1>
<h3>
   1. Overview
</h3>
PadiBagus is an application developed with the goal of enhancing rice farmers' productivity. This application is the result of implementing research titled "Classification of Rice Plant Diseases Using Rice Leaf Images with MobileNetv3 Large Convolutional Neural Network Architecture." This research is based on the decline in rice production and harvested rice field areas in Indonesia from 2021 to 2023. It is hoped that this application will contribute to an increase in rice production and harvested rice field areas in the future.
